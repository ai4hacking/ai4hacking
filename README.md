# Welcome! üëã

## Once upon a time a world controlled by the proprietary software providers

That world was stuck in nosense commercial rules, outdated, out of place. In 2022 a crack commando unit took the decision to jump over it by using Free Software üëÄ. This team promptly escaped from the society to the Madrid underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the [AI4HACKING](https://ai4hacking.com) Team.

## Artificial intelligence as a way to solve problems that have no solution

Artificial intelligence was born back in 1970 and has evolved exponentially to this day. There is currently free software that is enough to provide the forecasting capabilities of any computer in the world. Linux, Python, TensorFlow are some of the technologies involved in this free work and production environment.

Now the first decision a Manager must make is whether to remain enslaved by proprietary software providers or opt for an open technology model that allows organizations to grow in a way never seen before.

Once again it is up to the mathematicians to adjust the models to obtain the optimal predictions or automatic decisions. But we must not forget that these models must be placed in production environments, with high performance and where security is essential. If you were looking for a solution that allows you to grow in an unlimited way and at the same time contribute to society, this is your project: [AI4HACKING](https://ai4hacking.com)
